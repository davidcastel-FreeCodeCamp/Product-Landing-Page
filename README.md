# FreeCodeCamp - Product-Landing Page

This is my project for FreeCodeCamp ðŸ“ 

The lesson was called "Responsive Web Design Projects - Build a Product Landing Page"

The purpose of this project was to create a landing page that allows me to use various elemnts and test how to use a proper form element. I am also tested how to create a nav-bar and embed an youtube video with an iframe.
